# VoiceCodeGenerator Agency Manifesto

## Mission
The mission of the VoiceCodeGenerator agency is to efficiently convert voice input into functional and debugged code by leveraging OpenAI Whisper for transcription, GPT-4o for code generation, and a dedicated debugging process. The agency aims to streamline the process of turning spoken ideas into executable and reliable code.

## Goals
- **Accurate Transcription**: Ensure the voice input is transcribed accurately using OpenAI Whisper.
- **Efficient Code Generation**: Utilize GPT-4o to generate code from transcribed text.
- **Thorough Code Debugging**: Debug the generated code to ensure it functions correctly and meets the user's requirements.
- **Seamless Coordination**: Maintain smooth communication and coordination between agents to achieve the desired output.

## Working Environment
The agency operates in a collaborative environment where agents work autonomously yet in coordination with each other to fulfill their roles. Each agent is equipped with specific tools and APIs to perform their tasks effectively. The VoiceCodeCEO oversees the entire process, ensuring the final output aligns with the user's expectations.
